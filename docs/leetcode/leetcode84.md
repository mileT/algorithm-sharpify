```shell
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

** Example 2: **
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram-1.jpg "Example 1 iamge")
```shell
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

Constraints:
* `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
### Using Stack
```java
class Solution {
    public int largestRectaleArea(int[])
}
```
